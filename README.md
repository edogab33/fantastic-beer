# Fantastic Beer
A simple api service to manage your beer production!

# Run
To run the project just launch `docker-compose up --build` to create the container and run both the API service and the PostgreSQL database.

# Test
To run some tests install all the required dependencies with `npm i` (alternatively it should work anyway by installing Jest and Supertest only) and use `npm test` to launch them.
